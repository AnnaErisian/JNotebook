# JNotebook
Rich-text notetaking aplication for desktop use.  Intended to pair with a sister application for mobile use, but being developed first for various reasons, ease of iteration and familiarity of environment (having worked in JavaFX before) being the most influential.

Also my first real project with Kotlin.  Language is good.  Lots of bells and whistles.  I'm still only dipping my toes in.

Uses [TornadoFX](https://github.com/edvin/tornadofx), which is also good.
